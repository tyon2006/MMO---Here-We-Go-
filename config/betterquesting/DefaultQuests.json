To get you to the right biome, we need you to teleport yourself there with a command. \n\nUse the command §9/biomesop tpbiome \u003cbiomename\u003e§r to get you to the biome of your choice. Just replace \u003cbiomename\u003e with the fully qualified name of the biome you want. If you hit §9TAB§r while typing the command, it will help you with a list of options.\n\nWe recommend choosing tier 1 biome listed under the faction you chose in the previous quest. If you\u0027re still unsure, we\u0027ve got some samples below for each faction. You\u0027ll have to type this into chat yourself and run it.\n\n§6Dwarves of Dawholdt - BAWLS§r\n/biomesop tpbiome biomesoplenty:highland\n/biomesop tpbiome minecraft:mutated_redwood_taiga\n\n§5Dragons of the Mystic Accord - GRAYCE§r\n/biomesop tpbiome minecraft:jungle\n/biomesop tpbiome biomesoplenty:grove\n\n§cHumans of Stevannia - SKILLZ§r\n/biomesop tpbiome biomesoplenty:dead_forest\n/biomesop tpbiome minecraft:desert\n\nThe command can take a minute to run. Sometimes it doesn\u0027t work because the nearest instance of the biome you entered is too far for it to find. You will need to change which biome you want to go to and try again.\n\nWhen you\u0027re settled, finish this quest and use the command §9/sethome §rto make sure you spawn at home the next time you die. \n\n\n§n§r§o§8§7Look, we know this isn\u0027t perfect, but getting you to the right starting biome is absolutely necessary to set you up for success.
